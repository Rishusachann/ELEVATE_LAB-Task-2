### 1. **Summary Statistics:**
* Used `describe()` to find **mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, and percentiles**.
* Helps to understand **data spread and central tendency**.

### 2. **Histograms and Boxplots:**
* **Histograms:** Show distribution (shape) of numerical features like Age, Fare, SibSp, and Parch.
* **Boxplots:** Show spread and **identify outliers** using quartiles and whiskers.

### 3. **Pairplot and Correlation Matrix:**
* **Pairplot:** Visualizes relationships between all numeric features with color separation based on survival.
* **Correlation Matrix:** Shows **how strongly features are related** (positive, negative, or no relation).

### 4. **Identify Patterns, Trends, or Anomalies:*
* Observed that:
  * Younger and higher-paying passengers tend to survive more.
  * Some **extreme outliers** in Fare and Age.
  * Family-related features (SibSp, Parch) may show weak trends.

### 5. **Basic Feature-Level Inferences:**
* Inferred that:
  * Fare and Age are **important features** for survival.
  * Outliers could be special cases like VIPs or children.
  * Family size might have indirect effects on survival.
